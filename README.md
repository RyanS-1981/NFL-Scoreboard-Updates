The updated code is based on the Mikemountain nfl-led-scoreboard project. Running the main.py script through ChatGPT several times, I updated to script to include user-defined variables for display scale and x/y offsets. This is based on the original 64x32_config.json settings. So all that needs to be done is to open and edit the main.py file and change your scale size at the top of the script. THAT'S IT, FOLKS!


9/7/2025 Update:

Updated the code again. For reasons I don't understand, the live game screen wasn't working. So I reverted to an earlier version of the code. BUT there is a catch, you must adjust the HOME score X-Position in the live game section AFTER you set your scale at the top.
