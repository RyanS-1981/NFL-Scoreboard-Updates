The updated code is based on the Mikemountain nfl-led-scoreboard project. Running the main.py script through ChatGPT several times, I updated to script to include user-defined variables for display scale and x/y offsets. This is based on the original 64x32_config.json settings. So all that needs to be done is to open and edit the main.py file and change your scale size at the top of the script. THAT'S IT, FOLKS!
